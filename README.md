# Instagram---DRF-project

This is the second version of the Instagram project on my github. If you want to check the previous version [click here.](https://github.com/krzysztofgrabczynski/Instagram---Django-project)

## Description
Version two of the Instagram project, fully utilizes Django Rest Framework to build a comprehensive RESTful API. The project was divided into apps for user, post, comment, and social actions, each handling specific functionalities. The project uses DRF's features like generic views, viewsets, and mixins which helped to create view classes. Additionally, it uses custom mixins and permissions to effectively extend view behaviors, along with serializers, routers, and more.

The project has been dockerized, uses PostgreSQL database and linters such as Black, Flake8 and Mypy. The application has also been tested by unit tests (using pytest).

This app was created for educational purposes.
